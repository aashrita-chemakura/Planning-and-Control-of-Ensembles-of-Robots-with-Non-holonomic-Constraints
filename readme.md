Open and run the file main.py
The code should run and an output comprising of graphs and simulation in form of gif file should be generated in results folder.

Libraries Used:
1. numpy
2. math
3. matplotlib
4. imageio
5. cvxopt (for convex optimization. Download this library from: https://cvxopt.org/)



CHALLENGES FACED:

Although we were able to obtain all the required parameters and derive all the desired graphs, we werenâ€™t able to achieve the desired state for the problem for every configuration of the swarms. The reason for this being that we have considered the swarm bots to be initialized at random positions and the algorithm we designed wasn't that robust to achieve the required state in every case. Nonetheless, the results obtained in the study serve as a good estimationfor the results obtained in the original study.
